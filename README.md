## Recommended Resources

You may also see the list of recommended literature:

- [Underactuated Robotics](https://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/index.html) - the most recommended control book. It covers lots of topics providing mathematical proofs and practical applications of those methods. [pdf](https://disk.yandex.ru/i/mNgnYIjB-bJu9g) also available.
- [Modern Robotics](https://disk.yandex.ru/i/E2AQmGBGnNMpuA) - the comprehensive book provides more information about mechanical systems and control methods

You may also need additional video sources:

- [Modern Robotics](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLggLP4f-rq02vX0OQQ5vrCxbJrzamYDfx&si=SEDOkz-dKOGh6c4E) - playlist created according to the book [Modern Robotics](https://disk.yandex.ru/i/E2AQmGBGnNMpuA)
- [Control Bootcamp](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m&si=QtdDB0WAYxHpLQxu) - lectures by Steven Brunton. The playlist provides an information about the most important control algorithms

All the books and even more are available in pdf via our [Yandex Disk Library Folder](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/lcvE7rAMY8gIGg).
